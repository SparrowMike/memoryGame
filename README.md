# memoryGame

Simonous is a memory exercise tool specifically designed for musicians who wish to improve their ability to replicate musical pattern. It is based on the idea of attaching a colour to a sound, also known as “the colour of sound”.

Simply put, the user can pick scale he/she would like to practice with and the game would then generate a random note, if answered correctly another note would be added each time .

There are also additional settings available to make the game more or less challenging. The user is able to manipulate note durations as well as the intervals between the notes. Additionally there are representation of notes in a blinking colourful circles to represent “the colour of sound”.

SETTINGS Volume: Ability to adjust the loudness of the notes played.

Blink duration: Time of the light duration, go low for a fast blink or higher up for a longer blink duration.

Note interval: Time distance between the notes being played, low settings will make the notes being played fast.

Audio speed: Ability to adjust the speed of the notes, low setting will make the notes really

Jump to score: Simply enter a number of the notes you would like the computer to randomise

# memoryGame

Simonious is a memory exercise tool specifically designed for musicians who wish to improve their ability to replicate musical patterns. It is based on the idea of attaching a color to a sound, also known as "the color of sound."

Simply put, the user can pick the scale they would like to practice with, and the game will then generate a random note. If answered correctly, another note will be added each time.

There are also additional settings available to make the game more or less challenging. The user can manipulate note durations as well as the intervals between the notes. Additionally, there are representations of notes in blinking colorful circles to represent "the color of sound."

SETTINGS:

- Volume: Ability to adjust the loudness of the notes played.
- Blink duration: Time of the light duration. Go low for a fast blink or higher up for a longer blink duration.
- Note interval: Time distance between the notes being played. Low settings will make the notes being played fast.
- Audio speed: Ability to adjust the speed of the notes. Low settings will make the notes play really slow.
- Jump to score: Simply enter a number of the notes you would like the computer to randomize.

PANIC: Just in case the game glitches, press "Panic" to reset the entire game.
